**Let's try to dissect each folder directory!**

- `app/` - This contains all screen components of this app. Since expo works on a file-based routing, routing through screens is pretty straightforward. Refer to expo's official docs for more info.
- `assets/` - Contains your app's assets like static files, images, etc. You know about this already.
- `components/` - This contains all gluestack components, you can also place here your own custom components.
  - `ui/` - contains all gluestack ui components
    - `gluestack-ui-provider/` - contains all gluestack provider files
    - `*component name*/` - this contains all added gluestack components. If you've already worked with **shadcn ui**, it works the same like that.
- `hooks/` - This contains all custom react hooks you've set up for this app.
- `routes/` - This contains all files related to routing.
